# Terrain-Chatbot Frontend Development

## Running the Frontend

To start the frontend for development:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies (only needed the first time):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3000/ (React Scripts default).

Changes to the code will automatically reload the page.

### Notes

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

The first run may take a few moments as the dev server compiles the project for the first time. Subsequent runs are faster.

Do not `run npm create vite` or any other project generator as the frontend is already set up.

## Project Structure

frontend/
  src/
    app/                 # App initialization and routing; has styles/ for global/app-level styles
    components/          # Reusable UI components; each may have a styles/ folder for component-specific styles
    features/            # Domain-specific features (auth, user, dashboard, etc.)
    hooks/               # Custom React hooks
    pages/               # Pages (Next.js / Vite routing entry points)
    services/            # API client and service functions
    store/               # State management (e.g., Redux, Zustand)
    utils/               # Utility functions/helpers
  public/                # Public static files (images, favicon, etc.)
  tests/                 # Unit, integration, and acceptance tests
  package.json           # Node dependencies & npm scripts
  package-lock.json      # Exact dependency versions

### Notes
- The `app/` and `components/` folders include their own `styles/` subfolders for global and component-level styles.  
- The `public/` folder contains static assets served as-is.  
- Run `npm run dev` inside the `frontend/` folder to start the development server.

## Tests

Include frontend unit tests and acceptance tests in the `tests/` folder

This will be updated.
